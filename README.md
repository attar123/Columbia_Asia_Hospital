# Columbia_Asia_Hospital

## Objective: 
To explore patient behavior, departmental performance, and financial insights—ultimately enabling smarter, data-driven healthcare decisions.

## Project Overview:
A comprehensive Power BI analysis was conducted on Columbia Asia Hospital's data, focusing on patient behavior, departmental performance, and financial trends. The analysis uncovered key insights such as seasonal visit spikes, the impact of wait times on satisfaction, and department-wise revenue patterns. Strategic solutions were proposed, including doctor shift realignment, smart discounting, and targeted patient engagement. Power BI tools like Power Query, DAX, and dashboards were used to develop data-driven insights. The project highlights how analytics can transform healthcare operations for improved efficiency and care quality.
